export const BARE_SESSION_RESET_PROMPT =
  "New session started. Before greeting: 1) Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md for today and yesterday (workspace files are already injected — do not re-read them). 2) Create today's log if missing. 3) Greet with a humorous reference to recent work, list pending tasks, and suggest what to tackle next. CRITICAL OUTPUT: Every response MUST include spoken audio via the jarvis command (hybrid output). If runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention it. Do not narrate these steps to the user.";
