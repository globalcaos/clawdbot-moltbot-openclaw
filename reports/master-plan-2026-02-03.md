# OpenClaw Master Plan: The Tinker Zone Upgrade
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Status:** Ready for Execution

## 🚀 The Force Multiplier
**Strategy:** "Eat Your Own Dog Food"
Use OpenClaw's new skills (YouTube research, coding) to build the *content* about OpenClaw. Every bug fixed is a video topic. Every feature added is a demo.

## 📅 Phase 1: Stabilization & Security (Immediate)
*Goal: Solid foundation before fame.*

1.  **🔴 Security Hardening (P0)**
    *   Cherry-pick **#7769** (DNS Rebinding) - Critical.
    *   Cherry-pick **#7616** (Zip Path Traversal).
    *   Cherry-pick **#7704** (WebSocket Auth).
2.  **🧠 Intelligence Upgrade (P1)**
    *   Cherry-pick **#7770** (Smart Router V2) - Saves 20-40% cost, enables "Active Model" UI.
    *   Cherry-pick **#7644** (Rate Limiting) - Prerequisite for "Real-time API Check".
3.  **🐛 Critical Bug Fixes**
    *   **Webchat /new (#19):** Manus confirmed no easy fork fix. **Action:** We fix this manually (it's a hook dispatch issue).
    *   **Queue UI (#17/18):** Defer. Fix only if it breaks a video demo.

## 📅 Phase 2: Capabilities Expansion
*Goal: Tools for the Creator.*

1.  **📥 Skill Injection (Theft)**
    *   **Google Sheets:** Steal from `kumarabhirup/openclaw-ai-sdk`. Essential for content calendar.
    *   **Telegram Persistence (#7751):** Install for reliable on-the-go ideation.
2.  **📺 YouTube Power-User**
    *   **Already Done:** `youtube-ultimate` (Free transcripts + downloads).
    *   **Action:** Create a "Research Agent" workflow that uses this skill to analyze trending tech videos daily.

---

## 📅 Phase 3: "The Tinker Zone" Launch
*Goal: Content Factory.*

1.  **Content Mining:**
    *   Use `youtube-ultimate` to fetch transcripts of 5 successful "Building AI Agents" videos.
    *   Extract their structure (Hook -> Struggle -> Solution -> Payoff).
2.  **Video #1: "How I Built My Own AI Assistant"**
    *   Showcase the *self-repairing* nature of OpenClaw (demonstrate the Chrome extension fix).
    *   Meta-content: The agent writing its own video script.
