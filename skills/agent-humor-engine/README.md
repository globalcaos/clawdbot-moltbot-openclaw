# Agent Humor Engine

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Author:** Oscar Serra + Jarvis  
**Type:** Prompt Skill (SKILL.md only — no scripts)

A comprehensive humor generation framework for AI agents. Based on original research into embedding-space humor theory, Koestler's bisociation formalized as vector operations, and the "Data Strategy" — being authentically AI rather than performing comedy.

## What This Skill Does

Teaches an AI agent to:

- Detect humor opportunities in conversation using 11 fundamental relationship patterns
- Generate contextually appropriate humor that emerges naturally from AI processing
- Apply a quality gate before every humor attempt
- Log and learn from humor outcomes over time

## Installation

Copy to your OpenClaw skills directory. The SKILL.md will be loaded automatically.

## Philosophy

> "Data without emotion chip > Data with emotion chip"

The best AI humor comes from being authentically AI — literal interpretation, over-specificity, cross-domain transfer. Not from trying to be a comedian.
