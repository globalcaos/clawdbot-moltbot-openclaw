## 🎨 UI/UX Preferences (learned 2026-02-02)

Oscar prefers **minimal, information-dense interfaces**:
- No decorative boxes/bubbles around messages
- No redundant labels (avatars, names, timestamps if obvious from context)
- Compact one-liners over multi-line displays
- Every element must earn its screen space

## 🔐 Security Philosophy (learned 2026-02-02)

- **Code enforcement > documentation** — Rules I might forget need hooks/plugins
- **Layered security** — Hard rules + heuristics + user control
- **Human stays in control** — Configurable thresholds, not all-or-nothing

## 📤 Publishing Standards (learned 2026-02-02)

Before sharing code publicly (GitHub PRs, ClawHub skills):
- **Test thoroughly** — not just "it works once"
- **Mature it** — let it prove itself over days/weeks of real use
- **Check uniqueness** — is this actually solving something others haven't?
- **Reputation matters** — every public contribution reflects on us

*"We uploaded a YouTube skill and there were hundreds of similar ones."* — Don't be potato salad #47 at the potluck.

## 🤖 Multi-Model Strategy (2026-02-02)

**Primary Chain (real-time chat):**
1. Claude Opus 4.5 (primary)
2. Gemini 3 Pro (fallback on rate limit)

**Parallel Processing:**
- **Manus** — spawn for deep research, code projects, document analysis
- Works async (takes 5-60 seconds), results delivered when ready
- Use for: competitor research, technical analysis, code generation
- Cost: ~2-12 credits per task

**Decision Framework:**
- Quick question → Claude
- Rate limited → auto-failover to Gemini
- Deep research → spawn Manus task in parallel, keep chatting on Claude
- Long code project → Manus (better for multi-file generation)

### API Monitoring Reality Check (researched 2026-02-02)

| Provider | Usage API | Our Solution |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Claude | ❌ Requires Org | Internal tracker |
| Gemini | ❌ None exists | Internal tracker |
| Manus | ❌ Dashboard only | Task logger + manual |

**Key insight:** Internal tracking is the ONLY cross-provider solution that works.
