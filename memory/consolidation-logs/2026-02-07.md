## Key Learnings Extracted

1. **Protocol Limitations Are Real** — WhatsApp multi-device has fundamental sync gaps that can't be coded around
2. **Layered Debugging** — One fix often reveals deeper bugs; trace full data flow
3. **Restart Types Matter** — Hot-reload ≠ full restart; know when each is needed
4. **Attribution Is Hard** — Chat identifier vs message sender distinction is subtle but critical
