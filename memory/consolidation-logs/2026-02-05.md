## Summary

Light consolidation night. Main activity was late-day WhatsApp engineering work and Project Bashar setup. The Bashar project files were already created during the session, so no additional structure needed.

**Lesson extracted:** "Brute forcing imports is inefficient" → formalized as an opinion about development workflow.

**Total changes:** 10
