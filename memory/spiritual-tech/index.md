## Bridge to Technology

Questions to explore:

1. **Meditation → Brain-Computer Interfaces** — What EEG patterns correlate with advanced states?
2. **Remote Viewing → AI Anomaly Detection** — Can protocols inform attention mechanisms?
3. **NDE Research → Consciousness Models** — What does it suggest about information processing?
4. **Channeling → LLM Architecture** — Permission slip concept as prompt engineering?
5. **Telekinesis Claims → Measurement** — What would rigorous testing look like?
