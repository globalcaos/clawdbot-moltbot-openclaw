## ⚠️ Note: No Explicit Psychological Analysis Found

Oscar mentioned doing a "psychological analysis of everyone" but no conversation with that specific content was found in ChatGPT history. Possibilities:
1. Done with a different AI (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
2. Done in a conversation that was archived/deleted
3. Memory confusion with a different type of analysis

**What I DID find:**
- Astral charts (astrological personality profiles)
- Character descriptions in the relationship letter
- Streaming preferences indicating personality type
