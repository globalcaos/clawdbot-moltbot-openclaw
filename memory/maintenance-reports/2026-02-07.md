## 🔐 Security Status

### CRITICAL (2)
1. **Open groupPolicy with elevated tools** — WhatsApp groupPolicy="open" allows any group to add the bot. With elevated tools enabled, prompt injection risk is HIGH.
   - **Fix:** Set `groupPolicy="allowlist"` and tighten elevated allowlists.

2. **WhatsApp groups open with no allowlist** — No `groups` allowlist configured.
   - **Fix:** Add explicit group allowlist or switch to allowlist policy.

### WARN (2)
1. **Reverse proxy headers not trusted** — If exposing Control UI via proxy, configure `trustedProxies`.
2. **WhatsApp DMs share main session** — Multiple senders share context. Set `session.dmScope="per-channel-peer"` for isolation.
