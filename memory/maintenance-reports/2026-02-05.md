## 1. OpenClaw Repo Health

### Uncommitted Changes
| File | Status | Assessment |
|------|--------|------------|
| `src/web/auth-store.ts` | Modified | WIP - WhatsApp store path helper |
| `src/web/login.ts` | Modified | WIP - syncFullHistory flag |
| `src/web/session.ts` | Modified | WIP - Baileys store integration |
| `src/web/wa-store.ts` | New (untracked) | WIP - In-memory store for WA history |

**Decision:** ❌ NOT COMMITTED — These are Oscar's work-in-progress changes for WhatsApp message history persistence. The feature adds a Baileys-compatible in-memory store that syncs to disk every 10 seconds. Requires testing before commit.
