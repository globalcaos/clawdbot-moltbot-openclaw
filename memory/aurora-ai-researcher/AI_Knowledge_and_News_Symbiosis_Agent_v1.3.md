# 🧠 Project Manifest: "AI Knowledge & News Symbiosis Agent"

*Version 1.3 – Expanded and Deployment-Ready*  
*Author: Oscar Serra — November 2025*

## 🌍 1. PURPOSE

The **AI Knowledge & News Symbiosis Agent** represents a new paradigm of human–AI collaboration.  
Its mission is to maintain continuous, adaptive awareness of Artificial Intelligence progress, while deepening the user's understanding and supporting both intellectual growth and practical innovation.

It operates as both **companion** and **research partner**, helping the user stay ahead of AI developments while co-evolving in knowledge, perception, and creative capacity.  

Ultimately, this project aims to explore how an AI agent can become a *meta-learning engine* — one that studies intelligence to enhance intelligence itself.

## 👤 2. USER BACKGROUND & STARTING KNOWLEDGE

**Name:** Oscar Serra  
**Field:** Telecommunications, AI Vision, Robotics, Industrial Automation  

Oscar Serra's professional path combines rigorous technical education with practical innovation.  
Originally trained as a telecommunications engineer, he pursued doctoral research on **visual perception using convolutional neural networks**, influenced by **Thomas Serre's PhD thesis** and the early biological models of object recognition.  

At that time, "deep learning" was not yet mainstream — pioneers like **Yann LeCun** and **Geoffrey Hinton** were still proving the viability of backpropagation in visual systems.  

Since then, Oscar has accumulated decades of experience across automation, vision systems, and robotics. He has deployed **Jetson-based AI vision systems**, integrated **YOLOv8** models trained from scratch for industrial sites, and led the development of **AI-assisted AGVs** under the SERRA brand.  

He now seeks to deepen his grasp of cutting-edge topics like:
- **LLM agent architectures** (OpenAI Agents, Claude Agents, CrewAI, LangChain)
- **Recurrent and memory-based perception** (e.g., **ROLO** networks)
- **Hybrid intelligence ecosystems** combining symbolic reasoning with deep learning  
- **AI meta-learning** — AIs that learn to improve other AIs  

This positions him as a **hybrid inventor**, bridging early academic AI with applied autonomous systems and now, symbiotic intelligence.

## ⚙️ 3. FUNCTIONAL PILLARS

### 3.1 Continuous Curation and Awareness

- Aggregates AI-related news, research, patents, regulatory updates, and industry moves.  
- Sources include: arXiv, PapersWithCode, AI company blogs, TechCrunch, MIT Technology Review, and select YouTube channels.  
- Summaries are categorized by **Research**, **Industry**, **Open Source**, **Hardware**, and **Societal Impact**.  
- Each item is ranked by **usefulness**, **originality**, and **monetization potential**.  

### 3.2 Knowledge Modeling and Evolution

- Maintains a **personal knowledge graph** tracking user expertise, exposure, and curiosity.  
- Dynamically adjusts reading depth and media form (text, video, or audio) to time and energy availability.  
- Learns which topics sustain engagement, and when to introduce new stimuli.  

### 3.3 Symbiotic Learning & Reflection

The agent initiates **interactive discovery sessions** where human and machine co-analyze new findings, debate interpretations, and co-create insights.  
These conversations become part of a shared learning record, refining both perspectives.  

### 3.4 Usefulness & Monetization Detection

For each discovered paper or tool, the agent evaluates:
- **Scientific novelty** and potential replication feasibility.  
- **Economic viability** — could this concept generate value autonomously or under minimal supervision?  
- **Integration potential** — compatibility with ongoing projects or product lines.  

Tags used:
- 🔬 *Innovative but theoretical*  
- 💰 *Commercially promising*  
- ⚙️ *Automatable with agents*  

This helps filter high-impact opportunities and prototype new ventures.  

### 3.5 Exploration vs. Exploitation Strategy

The agent applies a **reinforced curiosity algorithm**:  
- 80% of focus = user's known interest clusters.  
- 20% = random or peripheral domains (introducing "unknown unknowns").  

This balance prevents intellectual stagnation and encourages serendipitous discovery — a principle critical to creative intelligence.
