## Core Principles (Quick Reference)

1. **Attention Decay** — Distant instructions get buried; use checklists near response time
2. **Code > Docs** — Enforce critical rules with code, not just documentation
3. **Consolidation** — Single source of truth + pointers, not duplication
4. **Memory = Soul** — Never delete, only reorganize
