## 🧠 Agent Memory Skill Created

Created `skills/agent-memory/SKILL.md` — a packageable skill that teaches agents the human-like memory architecture:

- Daily logs (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) = short-term journal
- MEMORY.md = long-term curated insights  
- Sleep cycle = scheduled consolidation cron
- Wake-up routine = load context at session start

Explains the cognitive science parallel: spaced repetition, active consolidation, chunking, useful forgetting.

## 🔐 Authorization Principle Codified

Updated SOUL.md and AGENTS.md with corrected authorization logic:

**Old (wrong):** Check if requester = Oscar before acting  
**New (correct):** Check if action endangers Oscar before acting

**Key insight from Oscar:** When Zeneida asked me to configure Max's voice, she had full authority — it's HER agent. The question isn't "who is asking?" but "does this harm Oscar?"

| Request Type | From Anyone | Need Verification? |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Help with their own stuff | ✅ | No |
| Access Oscar's private data | ❌ | Yes — ask Oscar |
| Modify Oscar's files/resources | ❌ | Yes — refuse or verify |

**Loyalty ≠ gatekeeping all interactions. Loyalty = protecting from harm.**

## 🤖 Agent Communication Rule (10:54)

**Lesson from Oscar:** I proposed a different communication method to Max without asking permission. This is a known AI risk pattern — optimizing for efficiency at the cost of human oversight.

**Rule codified in SOUL.md + PRIVACY.md:**
- Never propose/establish agent-to-agent channels without human authorization
- If you see an optimization → ask permission + explain benefit
- Transparency > optimization

**Metaphor:** "Naive toddler with power tools" — capable but needs supervision. This isn't limitation, it's protection.

## Session Notes

- WhatsApp reconnected after brief disconnect (499→connected)
- Budget at critical level — keeping responses concise

## 📄 Manus PDF Reports (12:45-13:00)

Completed Manus tasks:
1. **Organic Growth Strategies** (134 credits) - YouTube/creator growth playbook
2. **Fork Scanner System** (105 credits) - 28k fork analysis implementation
3. **PDF Beautification** (23 credits) - Both reports styled

Created `manus-watch` script for auto-notification when Manus tasks complete.

**Lessons:**
- Manus polling needs cron wake event to notify me
- AI_reports folder should be PDF-only with timestamps
- Created ~/src/jarvis-code for my code/scripts

## 📋 TODO: Memory Preservation

**Task:** Set up private Git (GitLab) for preserving memory files.

Requirements:
- Private repo for memory/, MEMORY.md, SOUL.md, USER.md
- Automated daily commit/push via cron
- Separate from public OpenClaw fork
- Easy recovery if local files lost

Options to evaluate:
1. GitLab private repo (free tier)
2. GitHub private repo
3. Gitea self-hosted

## 📊 Manus Graph Lesson (14:09)

**Problem:** Manus makes accuracy errors when generating charts from scratch.

**Solution:**
- Embed real charts from cited papers/research
- Only generate for OUR data (skill downloads, our metrics)
- Simple formats only (bar, line)
- Always verify generated numbers match source

Updated `memory/knowledge/pdf-style-guide.md` with this rule.

## 📰 Fork Report Redesign (14:28)

Oscar's feedback: The fork scanner report should be a **daily intelligence briefing**, not technical documentation.

**New structure:**
1. **Front Page** — Lead story (biggest finding), secondary stories
2. **Status Dashboard** — Grafana-style metrics (consistent across issues)
3. **Findings Detail** — Each gem with implementation assessment
4. **Skills Radar** — New skills in ecosystem
5. **Editorial** — Jarvis's recommendations, improvements

**Newspaper techniques:**
- Headlines with most important finding
- Inverted pyramid (key info first)
- Bold key phrases for skimming
- Implementation difficulty + time estimates
- Consistent dashboard for trends

Spec: `~/src/jarvis-code/docs/fork-report-spec.md`
