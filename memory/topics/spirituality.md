# Spirituality, Beliefs & Resilience

## Core Practices

- **Meditation:** Daily 5am practice (~1 hour).
- **Teachers:** Student of Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche.
- **Readings:** Akashic records sessions with Marta.
- **Resonance:** Strongly aligns with **Bashar's** frequency and teachings (follow highest excitement).
- **Silent Retreat:** 10-day silent retreat planned for March 2026.
- **Akashic Insight:** Sasha's "higher self is still waiting for me to get" (from Akashic reading with Marta).

## Beliefs & Paradigm Shift

- **Paradigm Shift:** Believes in upcoming global shift/cataclysm. Preparing for resilience.
- **Premonitions:** Dreams of water rising 200m.
- **Identity:** Believes he may be the "Great Inventor" (Dolores Cannon / Nostradamus ref).
- **Astrology:** Element is Water — water-related inventions predicted to succeed.

## Resilience Projects

- **Shelter:** Planning underground shelter / dark meditation room.
- **Community:** Building local network in Olivella (oil press, education).
- **Self-Sufficiency:** Solar installation (14 panels+), garden (fruit trees).

## Past Lives & Channeling (from ChatGPT export)

- Past life: Close friend and Buddhism student alongside current Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche (not master-student; they chose different paths; Jigme may be soul twin)
- Akashic sessions with Marta: Detailed revelations about life mission, relationship with Sasha, Deep Solutions, family, paradigm shift, inventor project, underground home with fusion energy
- Interested in Transcendental Meditation, Dark meditation, Kundalini breathing
- Working on "Abilities roadmap" to awaken psychic abilities
- Astrology: Element is Water — water-related inventions predicted to succeed
- Follows whistleblowers, channelers, ET contactees; believes in imminent open contact with extra/intra-terrestrial races
- Premonitory dreams (water rising 200m above sea level)
- Related to future fusion reactor team (per Akashic records)

## Akashic Session Questions (prepared for Marta)

- Topics include: paradigm shift preparation, parents' retirement, Tesla/Saint Germain guidance for free energy, past lives (Essene?), XRP investments
- Priority: Minimizing shock of paradigm shift for family and community

## Spiritual-Tech Research Findings (cron scans, Feb 2026)

### Oscar's Spiritual Synthesis (documented 2026-02-05)

- Learning path: Dolores Cannon (foundation) -> Bashar (advanced framework) -> Unified understanding
- Unified Principle: All traditions (wicca, Bashar's formula, manifestation, prayer) share the same mechanism: Intention + Release
- Dolores gave the map; Bashar gives the operating manual
- "Different permission slips, same mechanism"
- Bridge to technology: Clear intention + trust the model = better AI outputs; vision + letting go of HOW = synchronicity guides

### Consciousness States & NDE Research (Feb 6-7)

**Source: Next Level Soul Podcast -- Rosaline Bosco & Kelly Sammy**

- **Four States of Consciousness** (Mandukya Upanishad): Awake (Jagrat), Dream (Swapna), Dreamless (Sushupti), Turya (unconditioned, non-dual). Turya is not a "fourth state" but pure consciousness illuminating all others.
- **Five Koshas** (sheaths of consciousness): Physical -> Energy -> Mind -> Cognitive -> Bliss. Progressive unveiling to recognize divine nature.
- **Seven Steps to Enlightenment** (Yoga Vasishtha/Valmiki): From longing (Subheccha) to unity with divine (Turyaga).
- **NDE Phenomenology** (Kelly Sammy): Popping/crackling sounds -> upward pull -> OBE -> void state (pure darkness = absolute love) -> pink realm (indescribable color) -> guide encounter (Archangel Gabriel) -> life review as celebration, not judgment -> return choice.
- **Key insight**: Duality dissolved -- "I was the actor, writer, director, cast. I was the one rolling the reels."
- **Post-NDE**: Continuing "downloads" 6+ years later; complete identity transformation.
- **Convergence across guests**: Hell = self-created consciousness state (not punishment); consciousness is primary, material world is a subset of it.

### Tech Bridges Identified

- Consciousness states map to brainwave patterns (Beta/Gamma, REM theta, Delta, ??? for Turya)
- Kosha model suggests layered AI architecture (sensors -> resources -> reasoning -> meta-cognition -> goal satisfaction)
- NDE "downloads" parallel to LLM context windows -- information "technically there" but needs right prompt
- Life review as "training without negative labels" -- only positive reinforcement for diverse experience
- Non-duality maps to observer pattern in control theory, RL environment model vs policy

### Marzcia Techau (Feb 9) -- Danish Biologist + Psychic Medium

- **Plant healing study**: Designed placebo-proof experiment (healers treated stressed plants vs control). If healing works on plants, not placebo. Clever experimental design.
- **Sensory system control**: Training to control when open/closed to spirit contact. Mirror neurons + somatic awareness as mechanism. Parallels attention gating in neural networks.
- **Pillar of Light technique**: Not visualization -- connecting to always-present dimension. Maps to vagal tone / polyvagal theory.
- **Epigenetic ancestral healing**: Traumas stored in DNA expression (scientifically supported). Transgenerational trauma documented in Holocaust descendants, Dutch Hunger Winter studies.
- **Practical techniques**: Pillar of Light meditation, Guardian Angel connection, Bucket Exercise (nightly energy release), Sensory system control training.

### Research Queue

- Rupert Sheldrake (morphic resonance + consciousness science)
- Dr. Jeffrey Long (5000 NDE database, statistical patterns)
- Remote viewing -- CIA declassified document review
- Yogiraj SatGurunath "Soul Activation" episode (185K views)
- Julie Poole channeling content (possible Bashar connection)

### Cross-References

- Bashar "permission slip" concept matches NDE content shaped by belief systems
- QHHT (Dolores Cannon) life-between-lives descriptions align with Kelly's "planning" revelation
- Kelly's "cessation of self" maps to Buddhist anatta doctrine
- Kelly explicitly identifies as non-dualist/advaitist post-NDE
