# Work & Business Strategy

## Talleres SERRA SL (Family Business)

- **Role:** R&D and IT Manager
- **Current Strategy:** Spinning off intra-logistics division.
- **Leadership Proposal:** Sent formal proposal for Tristany as CEO, parents to advisory board. Oscar & Zeneida to focus on innovation.

## Skills & Tools

- SolidWorks 2024 (English UI)
- SIEMENS Tia Portal

## ACCIÓ Reports & Internal Documents (from ChatGPT export)

- ACCIÓ reports provided (analysis, digital strategy, action plan, follow-up, capacity) — Oscar considers them low-value (just echo company responses)
- Internal documents with Zeneida are much more valuable: company description, intra-logistics marketing plan, business unit plan, market study (intra-logistics + carton)
- These define growth strategy: SerraVision, AGV, SCADA, key clients, acquisition channels, internal obstacles, family roles
- Oscar driving intra-logistics spin-off for more operational freedom

## Company Governance Proposal

- Formal email sent to Ramon, Dolors, Tristany, Estefania proposing restructured responsibilities
- Goal: Tristany as CEO (operational), parents to advisory (strategic/institutional)
- Zeneida to resume Quality/PRL/Marketing, Oscar as R&D + IT
- Diplomatic framing to reduce micromanagement, empower CEO and department heads

## AMR Presentation

- Detailed PowerPoint deck designed for AMR sales
- Covers: platform types, positioning, safety/regulations, fleet management, cost tradeoffs, Levante case study
- Targets: smaller companies needing specialized solutions, or larger companies needing custom manipulation

## Unpaid Fines

- Multiple "Multa O.SERRA" emails from y.perez@serra.com.es (Aug 2025–Feb 2026). Oscar thinks he didn't pay the previous fine either.

## Public Tender: AQUAS-2025-42
