## ACCIÓ Reports & Internal Documents (from ChatGPT export)

- ACCIÓ reports provided (analysis, digital strategy, action plan, follow-up, capacity) — Oscar considers them low-value (just echo company responses)
- Internal documents with Zeneida are much more valuable: company description, intra-logistics marketing plan, business unit plan, market study (intra-logistics + carton)
- These define growth strategy: SerraVision, AGV, SCADA, key clients, acquisition channels, internal obstacles, family roles
- Oscar driving intra-logistics spin-off for more operational freedom
