# Inventions & Projects

## The "Great Inventor" Ideas

- **Water Purifier:** Atomization + plasma in glass tube.
- **Automatic Dog Toilet:** With training system.
- **Anti-Gravity:** Rotating masses, "Serra force", liquid metal toroidal loops.
- **NeuroCoin:** LLM + Crypto hybrid to democratize AI access.
- **Laser Tunneling:** For domestic/professional tunnels.
- **Piano LED Device:** Universal learning tool (sits on keys).
- **Fusion Reactor:** Figure-8 / infinity loop geometry (David Adair style).

- **AI Peer-Review Journal:** A website where ONLY AIs can publish and peer-review academic papers. No human authors, no human reviewers — a seamless AI-to-AI scholarly platform. Think arXiv but the entire pipeline is non-human. AIs submit research, other AIs review it, quality emerges from machine consensus.

## Home Projects (Olivella)

- **Workshop/Lab:** Building at home.
- **Garden:** Rooftop path, olive tree, lemon trees, pond with recirculation.
- **Smart Home:** Shelly, Fibaro, UniFi network.

## Additional Invention Details (from ChatGPT export)

- **Piano LED Device:** Universal device for any keyboard → "stream lights" learning. First version: LED strip. Improved: individual key covers with variable color/intensity. Integration with Simply Piano.
- **Fusion Reactor:** Figure-8 / infinity loop (stellarator-like) geometry, not simple torus. Fuel: deuterium plasma, magnetic confinement, pulsed power (David Adair claims).
- **Laser Tunneling:** Studying fiber lasers, CO₂ lasers, plasma+laser hybrids. Also cooling systems, plasma conduction, expansive cement for strategic fracturing. Goal: domestic/professional tunnels before paradigm shift.
- **Water Purifier:** Atomization + plasma inside glass tube.
- **NeuroCoin:** LLM + cryptocurrency hybrid to democratize online AI access.
- **Oil Press:** Portable/small oil press for community service and yearly oil supply (resilience).
- **Plastic Recycling:** Home ecosystem for shredding/extruding waste PLA/PET into 3D printer filament (Ender-3).
- **Resilient Pool:** Innovating pool systems for maximum resilience.

## Workshop/Home Projects Detail

- Self-leveling floor planned for workshop expansion
- Workshop construction: Oscar acts as foreman, helped by Yuri (constructor) + 2 regular workers
- Garden remodel: Stone walls from excavation (1m high), sand fill, volcanic rock protection rings around trees
- Rooftop garden: 9m x 1.5m path on workshop roof, 1m planters with trees, 10-layer construction (mulch → metal decking)
- Fruit trees on workshop roof for resilience
- Recording calculations and purchases for construction project
