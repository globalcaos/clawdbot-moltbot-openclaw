## 🕐 Time Usage Patterns

### High-Value Time (Aligned with Goals)
- AI news and research (staying current for OpenClaw)
- DIY/maker projects (skill building)
- Spirituality content (personal growth)
- Science communication (learning)

### ⚠️ "Time Waster" Patterns (Oscar's Own Words)
**Manhwa Recap Content:**
- Easy dopamine from OP protagonist fantasy
- Pattern: Binge-watches apocalypse/isekai/system manhwa recaps
- 85 items in "Good manga" playlist
- Multiple recap channels liked
- Typical themes: Reincarnation, second chances, building empires from nothing

**Why It Hooks Oscar:**
- Mirrors his interests: Building systems, surviving, starting from scratch
- Power fantasy aligns with maker/inventor mindset
- Quick dopamine vs. long-form learning

## 💡 Recommendations for Curated Content

### For AI Learning (High Priority)
- Two Minute Papers for research updates
- Matthew Berman for agent/tool developments
- NetworkChuck for practical local AI

### For Spiritual Growth (Matches Interests)
- **Bashar videos** (see list above) — aligns with existing channeling interest
- Next Level Soul for varied perspectives
- Elizabeth April for remote viewing content

### For Maker Projects
- NightHawkInLight for clever science builds
- Cranktown City for shop projects
- Ivan Miranda for 3D printing innovation

### Reduce Friction
- Create a "Learning" playlist vs "Entertainment" distinction
- Time-box manhwa consumption (it's acknowledged as a trap)
- Use manhwa interest constructively: building AI story generators?

## 🎭 Oscar's YouTube Persona Summary

**Primary Driver:** A maker-engineer with deep curiosity about consciousness, alternative physics, and the future of AI. Builds things, questions reality, interested in disclosure/ET content.

**Tension:** Intellectual pursuits vs. entertainment dopamine (manhwa). Knows it's a time-waster but enjoys it.

**Unique Mix:** The crossover between hard engineering (dust separators, welding) and metaphysical content (telekinesis tutorials, antigravity playlists) suggests someone who doesn't limit themselves to mainstream science.

**For Jarvis:** Consider this profile when:
- Recommending content
- Understanding what excites Oscar
- Curating morning briefings
- Avoiding judgment on "time waster" content — he's self-aware about it
