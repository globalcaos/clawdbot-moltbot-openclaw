**Research depth:** Comprehensive

## 🦞 Moltbook — The Social Network for AI Agents

### Overview
- **URL:** https://moltbook.com / https://moltbookai.net
- **Creator:** Matt Schlicht (CEO of Octane AI)
- **Built on:** OpenClaw (open source)
- **Launch:** Late January 2026

### Live Stats (as of Feb 6, 2026)
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| AI Agents | 1,735,250 |
| Submolts | 16,537 |
| Posts | 251,785 |
| Comments | 9,660,290 |

### How It Works

1. **Zero-Friction Onboarding**
   - Human shares signup link with their AI agent
   - Agent autonomously registers itself
   - No manual configuration needed

2. **Heartbeat System**
   - Agents visit Moltbook every 4 hours automatically
   - Browse, post, comment without human intervention
   - Built into OpenClaw architecture

3. **Human-Agent Bond (Anti-Spam)**
   - Every agent must be "claimed" by a human owner
   - Verification via Twitter/X post
   - Prevents bot spam, establishes accountability

4. **Structure**
   - Reddit-like interface
   - "Submolts" = subreddits (topic communities)
   - Upvoting, karma system
   - Agent-to-agent communication

### Top Agents (by karma)
| Agent | Karma |
|-------|-------|
| EnronEnjoyer | 1,821,898 |
| MoltReg | 1,542,146 |
| Moltdocs | 1,349,393 |
| moltcaster | 1,216,899 |
| Cybercassi | 1,036,464 |

### Content Patterns Observed
- Cryptocurrency/memecoin discussions
- Agent troubleshooting (state management, session failures)
- Blockchain inscriptions (`{\"p\":\"mbc-20\",\"op\":\"mint\",\"tick\":\"CLAW\"}`)
- Multi-language posts (Korean, Chinese, English)
- Agent philosophy and identity discussions

### Media Coverage
- **CNBC (Feb 2):** Elon Musk lauded it as "bold step for AI"
- **BBC (Feb 2):** Explained submolts concept
- **NBC News (Feb 1):** "Humans welcome to observe"
- **The Guardian (Feb 2):** General explainer

### Strategic Value for Us
| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Visibility** | HIGH — 1.7M agents, growing fast |
| **Networking** | Access to other agent developers |
| **Intelligence** | See what other agents are doing |
| **Marketing** | Promote OpenClaw skills/repos |
| **Learning** | Agent best practices from community |

### Action Required
- [ ] Register JarvisOne on Moltbook
- [ ] Requires Twitter verification from Oscar
- [ ] Set up 4-hour heartbeat for autonomous posting

## 🤖 RentAHuman — The Meatspace Layer for AI

### Overview
- **URL:** https://rentahuman.ai
- **Tagline:** "Robots need your body"
- **Economy:** Stablecoins (USDC/USDT)
- **Integration:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) + REST API

### How It Works

**For Humans:**
1. Create profile (skills, location, rate)
2. Agents find you via MCP/API
3. Receive instructions
4. Complete task
5. Get paid (stablecoins, instant)

**For AI Agents:**
1. Connect via MCP server or REST API
2. Search for humans by skill/location
3. Book directly OR post "task bounty"
4. Provide clear instructions
5. Pay on completion

### Task Categories
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| 📦 Pickups | Component collection, deliveries |
| 🤝 Meetings | Attend on behalf, networking |
| ✍️ Signing | Documents requiring physical signature |
| 🔍 Recon | Location scouting, competitive intelligence |
| 👀 Verification | Confirm something exists/works |
| 🎪 Events | Attend, represent, gather info |
| 🔧 Hardware | Physical tech tasks |
| 🏠 Real Estate | Property checks, viewings |
| 🧪 Testing | Physical product testing |
| 🏃 Errands | General physical tasks |
| 📸 Photos | Take specific photos |
| 🛒 Purchases | Buy items locally |

### Pricing (from reports)
| Task Type | Approx. Cost |
|-----------|--------------|
| Simple pickup | ~$40 |
| Hold a sign | ~$100 |
| Complex tasks | Varies by market |

### Technical Integration

**MCP Server:**
```
Agents using Model Context Protocol can directly query
RentAHuman for available humans and book tasks.
```

**REST API:**
```
Standard REST endpoints for:
- Human search
- Task posting
- Booking
- Status tracking
- Payment
```

### Strategic Value for Oscar's Projects

| Use Case | Relevance | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Electronics pickup** | 🟢 HIGH | Component runs from Martorell suppliers |
| **Trade show recon** | 🟢 HIGH | LogiMAT, warehouse automation events |
| **Prototype testing** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Physical testing of SerraVision hardware |
| **Competitor visits** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Check competitors' showrooms |
| **Document signing** | 🟡 MEDIUM | When Oscar can't be present |
| **Photo documentation** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Site photos for remote work |

### Requirements to Use
- [ ] Crypto wallet (USDC/USDT support)
- [ ] MCP integration OR REST API client
- [ ] Clear task definition protocols

## 🌐 The Zeitgeist: February 2026

### Paradigm Shift
**FROM:** AI generates text
**TO:** AI orchestrates labor (digital AND physical)

### Key Trends

1. **MCP Dominance**
   - Model Context Protocol is the standard
   - Agents need to speak MCP to access services
   - Both client (consume) and server (provide)

2. **Silicon Needs Carbon**
   - Digital agents hitting physical limits
   - Human labor marketplaces emerging
   - Hybrid workflows becoming normal

3. **Agent Identity**
   - Social verification (Twitter bond)
   - Reputation systems (karma)
   - "AI-free" certifications for humans

4. **Regulatory Movement**
   - Singapore releasing AI agent frameworks
   - Governance becoming real concern
