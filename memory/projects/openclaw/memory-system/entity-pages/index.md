## What Was Done

Created `bank/entities/` directory with structured profiles inspired by Letta/MemGPT architecture.

### Files Created
- `bank/entities/Oscar.md` — Owner profile
- `bank/entities/Sasha.md` — Wife
- `bank/entities/Elisenda.md` — Daughter (8yo)
- `bank/entities/Marcus.md` — Newborn son (Dec 2025)
- `bank/entities/JarvisOne.md` — Self-reference

### Structure
Each entity page contains:
- Basic facts
- Relationships
- Preferences
- Notes

## Why

- **Before:** Information scattered across daily logs
- **After:** Single source of truth for each entity
- **Benefit:** Quick lookup, consistent updates

## Related Research

- Letta (formerly MemGPT) — "Core memory" concept
- Entity-based memory systems outperform chronological logs for relationship tracking
