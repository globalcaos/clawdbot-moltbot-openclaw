# Project Folders

*Organizing memory by project instead of chronology.*

---

## Status
✅ Closed (2026-02-04)

## What Was Done

Created `memory/projects/` hierarchy with:
- Master index at `memory/projects/index.md`
- Folder per project with its own `index.md`
- Subfolders for sprints/improvements
- Status tracking (🟢 Open, 🟡 Paused, ✅ Closed, ❌ Abandoned)

### Projects Created
- openclaw (self-improvement)
- pallet-scan
- amr-marketing-sales
- serravision-ai
- talleres-serra-spinoff
- book-translation
- workshop-legalization
- home-olivella (with sub-projects)
- inventions (with sub-projects)

### Convention Added to AGENTS.md
```markdown
### 📁 Project Memory

Projects live in `memory/projects/<project-name>/`. Each project has:
- `index.md` — Purpose, status, key decisions, links
- Subfolders for sprints/phases
```

## Why

- **Before:** Context scattered across daily logs by date
- **After:** Context grouped by project
- **Benefit:** Open project folder, read index, have full context
