# The Formula & The Five Laws

## The Five Laws of Creation
These are the only non-negotiable constants in existence. Everything else is a variable (an agreement/belief).

1.  **You exist.** (You cannot cease to exist. You can only change form.)
2.  **Everything is here and now.** (Space and time are illusions.)
3.  **The One is All and the All is One.** (Holographic nature; every part contains the whole.)
4.  **What you put out is what you get back.** (Physics/Law of Attraction. Vibrational resonance.)
5.  **Everything changes except the first 4 laws.**

## The Formula for Excitement
The instruction manual for navigating life efficiently:
1.  **Act** on your highest excitement...
2.  **To the best** of your ability...
3.  **With absolutely zero** expectation of the outcome.

**Why it works:** Excitement is the physical translation of the Higher Self saying "This is the path." It is the homing beacon.

## Abundance
Definition: "The ability to do what you need to do, when you need to do it."
- It is NOT just money. Money is one valid form, but insisting on money blocks other forms (gifts, synchronicity, exchange).
