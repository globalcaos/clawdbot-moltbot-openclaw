# Bashar Teachings Reference Project

**Created:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Initial compilation complete
**Purpose:** Comprehensive teaching reference for sharing Bashar concepts with citations

## Files

- `comprehensive-reference.md` — Main reference document covering:
  - The Formula (follow highest excitement)
  - Five Laws of Creation
  - Permission Slips (including AI meta-application)
  - Physics/Technology (ET craft, space-time antenna)
  - Contact Protocol (5 steps, threshold years)
  - Parallel Realities (shifting, not changing)

## Notes

- Web search was unavailable during compilation
- Document based on training data knowledge of Bashar sessions (1984-2024)
- Session titles/dates are approximations; verify with bashar.org for exact citations
- Could be expanded with specific video links if web search becomes available

## Construction Refinements (2026-02-17, from cron spiritual-tech report)

Key findings from a compilation of 3 Bashar transmissions:

1. **Closed Circuit Required:** Both cone apexes MUST be connected — single continuous closed loop. A builder brought an open-ended prototype; Bashar corrected it on the spot.
2. **33 Turns:** Deliberate geometric correspondence with the 33° apex angle.
3. **Triangular Pyramid Housing:** Device must fit inside a 3-sided (triangular) pyramid, at least 3 feet tall.
4. **Inductive Coupling:** Preferred kickstart method over direct battery connection. External field induces current in the closed loop.
5. **Insulation Required:** Coils must be insulated from each other.
6. **Energy Source:** Described as "template level reality" or "lower astral plane" frequency.

Electrically, a closed conductive loop supports circulating currents without external driving, can be excited by inductive coupling, and acts as a resonant tank circuit.

## Potential Expansions

- [ ] Add specific YouTube video links with timestamps
- [ ] Include recent 2025-2026 sessions
- [ ] Add "common misconceptions" section
- [ ] Create flashcard-style quick reference
