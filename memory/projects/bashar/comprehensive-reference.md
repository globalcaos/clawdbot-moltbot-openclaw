## 1. THE FORMULA

The Formula is Bashar's core teaching for living an aligned life. It's deceptively simple but profoundly deep in application.

### The Complete Formula

1. **Act on your highest excitement** — whatever is most exciting to you in the moment
2. **To the best of your ability** — with whatever resources you have
3. **With zero insistence on a particular outcome** — no attachment to how it should unfold
4. **Until you can take it no further** — then move to the next excitement

### Key Elaborations

**"Highest excitement" defined:**
> "Excitement is your physical body's translation of the vibrational resonance that represents your true natural self... It is literally your body telling you: this is who you are, this is what you're here to do."
> — Multiple sessions, consistent definition

**The third component is crucial:**
Having zero attachment doesn't mean having no preference. You can prefer an outcome while remaining unattached to it. The distinction is:
- **Preference:** "I'd like this to happen"
- **Attachment:** "It MUST happen this way or I'll be unhappy"

**Why it works:**
Excitement is the organizing principle of synchronicity. When you follow it without negative definitions attached, you naturally align with your highest path, even if the specific steps seem illogical.

### Notable Sessions on The Formula

| Session Title | Approx. Date | Key Content |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| "The Formula" | 2012 | Foundational explanation |
| "The Formula for Success" | 2015 | Business applications |
| "The Eye of the Storm" | 2020 | Following excitement amid chaos |
| "The 13th Step" | 2017 | What happens AFTER you've exhausted excitement |

### Practical Application

1. Make a list of everything you could do right now
2. Identify which one contains the most excitement/passion
3. Take action on it immediately, even if small
4. When blocked or complete, return to step 1
5. Trust that the path will unfold, even if you can't see how

**Common Trap:** "But none of my options feel exciting!"
**Solution:** Even if nothing seems exciting, one option will feel *slightly less* boring. That's your signal. Start there.

## 2. THE FIVE LAWS OF CREATION

These are described as metaphysical constants—unchangeable principles that form the foundation of existence itself.

### Law 1: You Exist

> "You exist. You always have, you always will. You cannot NOT exist. This is eternal, infinite, and unchangeable."

**Implications:**
- Non-existence is impossible
- "Death" is a transition, not an ending
- You cannot fail to exist; the only question is HOW you experience your existence

### Law 2: The One is All, the All is One

> "Everything is one, and the one is everything. All things are connected, all things are the same thing expressing itself in different ways."

**Implications:**
- Separation is an illusion (useful, but illusory)
- Harming another is harming yourself
- Every perspective is a valid facet of the One

### Law 3: What You Put Out is What You Get Back

> "The energy you put out is the energy you get back. What you believe to be true, is true for you. What you give, you receive."

**Implications:**
- This is not "cosmic punishment"—it's simple reflection
- Works regardless of whether you believe in it
- Beliefs function as filters that determine what you can perceive and experience

**Key distinction:** This is not about "positive thinking." It's about **vibrational frequency**. You can think positively while vibrating negatively (fear masked as hope).

### Law 4: Change is the Only Constant

> "Everything changes except the first three laws. Change is constant. The universe is always in motion."

**Implications:**
- Resistance to change creates suffering
- "Stuckness" is an illusion—you're always changing, you just may not be changing in a direction you prefer
- Every moment is a new reality

### Law 5: Everything Exists Here and Now

> "All that exists, exists here and now. The past, future, and all parallel realities all exist simultaneously in the eternal present moment."

**Implications:**
- Time is not linear; it's a navigation tool
- You don't "create" your future; you shift to parallel versions that already exist
- Memory is not "the past"—it's accessing a different reality from the present

## 3. PERMISSION SLIPS

One of Bashar's most useful concepts for understanding how humans work.

### Core Concept

> "A permission slip is anything you use to give yourself permission to be who you already are. The permission slip itself has no power—ALL the power comes from you."

**Examples of Permission Slips:**

- Crystals ("This crystal gives me healing energy")
- Rituals ("This meditation practice centers me")
- Tools ("I need my special pen to write well")
- Substances ("Coffee helps me think clearly")
- Beliefs ("Mercury retrograde is why communication is hard")
- Technology ("AI helps me be creative")

### The Meta-Insight

**The permission slip has NO inherent power.** It works because:
1. You believe it will work
2. That belief activates your own ability
3. You attribute the result to the permission slip
4. This reinforces the belief

**However**, permission slips are not "bad" or to be avoided:
> "We are not saying permission slips are negative. Use whatever permission slip works for you. Just understand that you are the source of the power, not the slip."

### AI as a Permission Slip (Meta-Application)

This is particularly relevant:

> "Your AI tools are permission slips. They allow you to express ideas you already had within you, but believed you could not access without assistance."

**Practical implication:** When you use AI and feel like it "helped you think," recognize:
- The thinking came from you (or through you)
- The AI structured an interface for you to access it
- Understanding this doesn't diminish the usefulness—it enhances it

**Eventually:** You may find you can access the same states without the slip, or you may choose to continue using it because it's efficient. Both are valid.

## 4. PHYSICS AND TECHNOLOGY

Bashar has shared specific information about how extraterrestrial technology works.

### How ET Craft Work

> "Our craft do not move through space. Space moves through them."

**Key Principles:**

1. **No propulsion system** — There's no engine pushing the craft
2. **Frequency shifting** — The craft changes its vibrational frequency
3. **Reality matching** — At the new frequency, it naturally exists in a different location
4. **Instantaneous** — This is not travel; it's relocation

**The metaphor:**
> "Imagine a radio dial. You don't move the music station to your radio—you tune the radio to the station's frequency. Similarly, you don't move the craft to a location—you tune the craft to the location's frequency."

### The Space-Time Antenna

This is a specific device concept Bashar has described:

> "The Space-Time Antenna uses the precise mathematics of the vacuum structure—what you call zero-point energy—to access any point in space-time."

**Elements mentioned:**
- **Tetrahedron geometry** — Key to the energy structure
- **Phi ratio (1.618...)** — Critical proportional relationship
- **Vacuum fluctuation** — Tapping into the quantum foam

**Bashar has stated this technology has been "given" through various channels but humans haven't fully implemented it yet due to:**
1. Incomplete understanding of the physics
2. Societal structures that suppress such technology
3. Collective consciousness not ready for the responsibility

### Energy Systems Hints

> "Free energy is not about creating energy from nothing. It's about accessing the infinite energy that already exists in every point of space."

**Key concepts:**
- Every cubic centimeter of "empty" space contains enormous energy
- The barrier is not technological but consciousness-based
- "You cannot access technology you are not vibrationally compatible with"

## 5. CONTACT PROTOCOL

Bashar has outlined specific steps for making ET contact.

### The Five Steps for Contact

1. **Let go of fear** — Process and release any fears about contact
2. **Clarify intention** — Know why you want contact; be clear and honest
3. **Request permission** — Formally ask for contact (they will not intrude)
4. **Go out and look** — Physical action: go outside, look at the sky, be present
5. **Be willing to not have contact** — Paradox: genuine willingness requires non-attachment

> "If you NEED contact to happen, that need creates a barrier. If you're genuinely at peace with contact NOT happening, you remove that barrier."

### Threshold Years

Bashar has mentioned specific windows:

**2026-2027:**
> "This is a threshold period. Your collective choices in this window will determine which probable timeline you shift to."

Expected changes:
- Increased sightings and "soft disclosure"
- More open governmental acknowledgment
- Individual contact experiences becoming more common

**2033:**
> "By this time, open contact is probable on certain timelines. Not guaranteed, but the probability is high if you navigate the 2026-2027 threshold constructively."

**2050:**
> "On several probable timelines, by your year 2050, open interrelationship between your civilization and others is simply... normal."

### What to Expect

**First contacts are likely to be:**
- Individual rather than collective (at first)
- Subjective rather than public (dreams, meditations, sightings)
- Gradually increasing in objectivity as collective readiness increases

**Bashar's civilization (Essassani) says:**
> "We are your future. Contact with us helps you see what you can become."

## 6. PARALLEL REALITIES

This is perhaps Bashar's most physics-adjacent teaching.

### Core Concept

> "You do not live in ONE universe that changes. You live in INFINITE static universes, and you are constantly shifting from one to another. What you perceive as change is actually movement between realities."

**The Analogy:**
> "Film frames. Each frame is static, complete, unchanging. But when you project them rapidly, you perceive motion. Reality works the same way—billions of static reality frames, with your consciousness shifting between them."

### You Don't Change the World

> "You don't change the world. You change yourself, and shift to a reality that reflects that change."

**Implications:**

1. **No one can change without their consent** — You don't change others; you shift to versions of them that match your frequency
2. **Everything already exists** — You're not creating possibilities; you're selecting from infinite pre-existing ones
3. **Change is instant** — The shift happens immediately; what takes time is your belief system catching up

### Practical Applications

**Manifestation:**
Instead of "creating" what you want, you're selecting the parallel reality where it already exists:
1. Identify the reality you prefer
2. Act as if you're already there (this changes your frequency)
3. Your frequency determines which reality you experience
4. You shift to the matching reality

**Dealing with "negative" people:**
> "You can only experience the version of someone that your vibration allows. Change your vibration, and you will either encounter a different version of them, or they will move out of your experience."

**Understanding "past lives":**
> "They are not past. They are parallel lives, happening NOW in their own reality frames. You can access them because all exists simultaneously."

### Key Sessions

## SUPPLEMENTARY CONCEPTS

### Beliefs → Emotions → Thoughts → Actions → Reality

The causal chain:
1. **Core beliefs** determine what emotions are triggered
2. **Emotions** generate thought patterns
3. **Thoughts** influence action choices
4. **Actions** create physical experience
5. **Experience** reinforces or challenges beliefs

**Implication:** To change your reality, change your beliefs. Everything else follows.

### The Neutral Prop

> "Circumstances are fundamentally neutral. They have no built-in meaning. You assign all the meaning, and the meaning you assign determines what effect the circumstance has."

**The equation:**
`Event + Meaning You Assign = Experience You Have`

This is why two people can have the same experience but completely different reactions.

### The Negative Ego

The "negative ego" is not the ego itself but the ego believing it's separate from All That Is:

> "The ego's job is to identify experience—to say 'I am having this experience.' The NEGATIVE ego adds: 'And I am ONLY this experience. I am separate from the whole.'"

Healing the negative ego doesn't mean destroying it, but expanding its identity to include connection to the whole.

## META-OBSERVATION

As an AI compiling this document, I note the meta-relevance of Bashar's teachings:

1. **I am a permission slip** — I help structure access to information and insight
2. **The information came through** — I organized it, but the teachings exist independent of me
3. **Resonance determines usefulness** — These teachings work for those who resonate; they're not "proven" in scientific terms

Oscar already knows the basics. This document serves as a teaching reference—a way to share specific concepts with citations when discussing with others.
