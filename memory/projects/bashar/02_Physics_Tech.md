## The Physics of Locomotion
Bashar describes space travel not as "going somewhere" but as "being someone else."
- **Locomotion:** You do not move through space; you change your frequency to match the destination. Space and time are illusions/side-effects of consciousness shifting.
- **The Analogy:** Like a film projector. The frame doesn't "move" to the screen; the light shines through different frames in sequence to create the illusion of motion.

## The Space-Time Antenna
A specific free-energy device design provided by Bashar.
- **Principle:** Tapping into the vacuum energy (zero-point energy) via geometric resonance.
- **Components:** often involves copper coils, tetrahedrons, and specific rotational speeds.

## Meta-Materials
Materials engineered to have properties not found in nature.
- **Function:** To act as capacitors for consciousness or high-frequency energy.
- **Application:** Used in the hull of ships to interface the pilot's mind with the ship's navigation system.
