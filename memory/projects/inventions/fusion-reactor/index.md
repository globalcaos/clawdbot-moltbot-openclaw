# Fusion Reactor

*Figure-8 / infinity loop geometry.*

---

## Status
🟡 Theoretical Research

## Concept

A fusion reactor design using figure-8 (infinity ∞) loop geometry instead of traditional tokamak (donut) or stellarator designs.

## Inspiration

**David Adair** — Aerospace designer who described advanced propulsion systems with unconventional geometries.

## Why Figure-8?

Theoretical advantages:
- Magnetic field topology may be more stable
- Natural plasma flow patterns
- Possibly simpler confinement
- Resonance effects?

## Challenges

Fusion is hard because:
- Plasma at 100+ million degrees
- Magnetic confinement stability
- Energy break-even (Q > 1)
- Materials that survive neutron bombardment

## Research Questions

- Has anyone tried figure-8 geometry?
- What are the magnetic field equations for this shape?
- Can it be simulated before building?
- What's the minimum viable scale?

## Disclaimer

⚠️ This is highly speculative. Real fusion research requires:
- Massive budgets
- Specialized equipment
- Teams of physicists
- Decades of iteration

This folder tracks ideas and research, not a near-term build project.
