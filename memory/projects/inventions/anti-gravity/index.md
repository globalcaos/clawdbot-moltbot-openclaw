# Anti-Gravity Research

*Exploring unconventional propulsion and levitation.*

---

## Status
🟡 Research/Theoretical

## Approaches Under Consideration

### 1. Rotating Masses
Based on theories about gyroscopic effects and inertial manipulation.

**Concept:** Precise rotation patterns may create asymmetric forces.

### 2. "Serra Force"
Oscar's proprietary theoretical framework (details internal).

### 3. Liquid Metal Toroidal Loops
**Concept:** Circulating liquid metal (gallium? mercury?) in toroidal geometry.

**Inspiration:**
- Electromagnetic effects in conductive fluids
- Possible connection to magnetic field manipulation

## Research Influences

- David Adair's aerospace designs
- Various alternative physics theories
- Historical "free energy" research

## Challenges

- Measuring extremely small forces
- Distinguishing real effects from experimental artifacts
- Theoretical framework to guide experiments

## Safety Notes

⚠️ Some approaches involve:
- High voltages
- High-speed rotation
- Liquid metals (toxicity)

Proper safety protocols required.

## Documentation

As experiments are conducted, document:
- Setup and parameters
- Measurements
- Results (positive AND negative)
- Lessons learned
