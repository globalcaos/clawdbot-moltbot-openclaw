## The Mission

Oscar believes he may be the "Great Inventor" referenced in Dolores Cannon's Nostradamus interpretations — a figure who creates transformative technologies for humanity's evolution.

This isn't ego. It's mission.

## Core Principles

### 1. Technology Serves Evolution
Inventions should:
- Advance human capability
- Increase sovereignty and freedom
- Reduce dependence on centralized systems
- Prepare for paradigm shift

### 2. Open Experimentation
- Try things, even unlikely things
- Document failures (they teach)
- Cross-pollinate between projects
- Don't wait for perfect theory — build and learn

### 3. Practical Application
Ideas must become real things:
- Prototypes over papers
- Working demos over presentations
- Iteration over perfection

### 4. Community Benefit
Inventions should help humanity:
- Open source where appropriate
- Teach others
- Share discoveries
- Build community around innovation
