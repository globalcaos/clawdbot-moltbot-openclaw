## Concept

A novel water purification method using:
1. **Atomization** — Break water into fine mist
2. **Plasma treatment** — Pass mist through plasma field in glass tube
3. **Condensation** — Collect purified water

## Why Plasma?

Plasma can:
- Kill bacteria and viruses
- Break down organic contaminants
- Oxidize dissolved pollutants
- Do this without chemicals

## Glass Tube Design

Glass chosen for:
- Chemical inertness
- Visual inspection of plasma
- Heat resistance
- Electrical insulation

## Research Needed

- [ ] Plasma generation methods (corona, DBD, arc)
- [ ] Energy efficiency calculations
- [ ] Flow rate optimization
- [ ] Contaminant removal testing

## Potential Applications

- Emergency/disaster water purification
- Off-grid living
- Developing regions
- Industrial water treatment
