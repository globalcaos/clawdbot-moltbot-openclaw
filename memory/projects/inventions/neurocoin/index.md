*LLM + Crypto hybrid to democratize AI access.*

---

## Status
🟡 Conceptual

## Vision

Make AI accessible to everyone through tokenomics.

**Problem:** AI (especially powerful models) is expensive and centralized.

**Solution:** A token economy that:
1. Lets people earn tokens by contributing resources
2. Lets people spend tokens to access AI
3. Creates a decentralized AI access layer

## Possible Mechanisms

### Earning Tokens
- Contributing compute (like Folding@Home but for AI)
- Contributing data (with proper privacy)
- Contributing human feedback (RLHF)
- Running inference nodes

### Spending Tokens
- API access to models
- Fine-tuning credits
- Priority queue access
- Premium features

## Technical Challenges

- Verifiable computation (proof of work for AI)
- Model distribution (large models are huge)
- Latency (decentralization adds overhead)
- Quality control (not all compute is equal)

## Economic Design

- Token supply mechanics
- Inflation/deflation controls
- Incentive alignment
- Attack resistance (Sybil, etc.)

## Research Needed

- [ ] Existing AI + crypto projects
- [ ] Decentralized inference protocols
- [ ] Token economic models
- [ ] Legal/regulatory landscape

## Philosophical Alignment

Aligns with Oscar's values:
- Democratization of technology
- Resistance to centralized control
- Sovereignty and individual empowerment
