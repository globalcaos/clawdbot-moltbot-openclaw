# Talleres SERRA Spin-off History

*Business restructuring to separate intra-logistics innovation.*

---

## Background

**Talleres SERRA SL** is Oscar's family business in Martorell.
**Oscar's Role:** R&D and IT Manager

---

## The Problem

The family business has two distinct operations:
1. **Traditional work** — Core business operations
2. **Innovation** — Intra-logistics, AI vision, robotics (Oscar's focus)

These don't always fit well together. The spin-off separates them.

---

## The Proposal

Oscar submitted a formal leadership proposal:

| Role | Person | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| Spin-off CEO | Tristany | Day-to-day operations |
| Advisory Board | Parents | Strategic guidance |
| Innovation Lead | Oscar & Zeneida | R&D, new products |

---

## Remote Work Negotiation

Oscar is negotiating a hybrid schedule:

| Day | Location |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Remote (Olivella) |
| Tuesday | Office (Martorell) |
| Wednesday | Flexible/Remote |
| Thursday | Office (Martorell) |
| Friday | Remote (Olivella) |

This allows focus time for innovation while maintaining presence.
