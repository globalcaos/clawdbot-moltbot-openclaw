# Solar Energy

*Solar installation at Olivella property.*

---

## Status
🟢 Active (expanding)

## Current Installation

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Panels | 14 solar panels |
| Storage | Battery system (capacity TBD) |
| Orientation | Standard roof mount |

## Planned Expansion

### Vertical East-West Panels

**Concept:** Additional panels mounted vertically, facing east and west.

**Benefits:**
- Captures morning and evening sun
- Complements midday production from roof panels
- May smooth out production curve
- Potentially better for winter sun angles

**Challenges:**
- Structural mounting
- Wind load
- Aesthetics
- Permit requirements

## Goals

1. **Energy independence** — Reduce/eliminate grid dependence
2. **Resilience** — Power during outages
3. **Cost savings** — Lower electricity bills
4. **Environmental** — Clean energy

## Connection to Shelter Project

Solar + battery storage is critical for the underground shelter plan — need power that works off-grid.

## Monitoring

Consider:
- Production monitoring system
- Battery state of charge tracking
- Grid export/import logging
