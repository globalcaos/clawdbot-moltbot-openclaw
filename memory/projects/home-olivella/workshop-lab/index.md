# Workshop/Lab

*Building a workshop and laboratory at home.*

---

## Status
🟢 Active (under construction)

## Purpose

A dedicated space for:
- **Invention prototyping** — Building the "Great Inventor" ideas
- **Electronics work** — PCB assembly, testing, repair
- **Woodworking** — Furniture, fixtures, enclosures
- **Experimentation** — Science, materials, processes

## Equipment (Planned/Available)

| Category | Items |
|----------|-------|
| 3D Printing | Creality Ender-3 (available) |
| Electronics | Soldering, oscilloscope, power supplies |
| Hand tools | Standard workshop set |
| Workbench | Sturdy surface for projects |
| Storage | Organization for components/materials |

## Connection to Legalization Project

The workshop is part of the Mas Mestre legalization effort — needs proper permits to be fully compliant.

See: [workshop-legalization](../../workshop-legalization/index.md)

## Safety Requirements

- Electrical safety (proper grounding, breakers)
- Ventilation (for soldering, chemicals)
- Fire safety (extinguisher, smoke detection)
- First aid kit
- Eye/ear protection

## Future Capabilities

As the workshop grows, add:
- CNC router (small scale)
- Laser cutter
- Better 3D printer
- Metalworking basics
- Chemistry setup (controlled)

## Collaboration Space

The workshop can host:
- Friend Wauter (metal work)
- Engineer Sami (projects)
- Science classes for local kids
