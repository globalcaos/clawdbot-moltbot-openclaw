## 🔥 TOP FINDINGS

### 1. YOLOv26 — Edge-First Object Detection (BREAKTHROUGH)

**Source:** [Ultralytics / LearnOpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/yolov26-real-time-deployment/)

**What:** YOLOv26 released January 2026 with radical simplification:
- **NMS-free detection** — One-to-One head eliminates post-processing
- **No DFL** — Removed Distribution Focal Loss for clean INT8/FP16 quantization
- **MuSGD optimizer** — LLM-inspired training from Muon optimizer
- **STAL + ProgLoss** — Small target awareness built-in

**Benchmarks:**
| Model | mAP (50-95) | CPU (ONNX) | GPU (T4 TensorRT) |
|-------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| YOLOv26-n | 40.9 | ~39ms | 1.7ms |
| YOLOv26-m | 53.1 | ~220ms | 4.7ms |

- **43% faster on CPU** vs YOLOv11/12
- Sub-2ms latency on T4 for nano model

**YOLOE-26:** Open-vocabulary variant — set classes at runtime via `model.set_classes(["hard hat", "safety vest"])`

| Score | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| 🔬 Scientific | 4/5 |
| 💰 Commercial | 5/5 |
| ⚙️ Automation | 5/5 |
| 🔗 Projects | **SerraVision**, **Pallet Scan**, **Gantry Robot** |

**Why this matters for Oscar:** The NMS-free design + INT8 quantization = perfect for Raspberry Pi / Jetson deployment. YOLOE-26 could enable dynamic class detection for new pallet types without retraining.

### 2. Real-Time AI Video Generation — Scope/StreamDiffusion

**Source:** [DEV.to — Daydream](https://dev.to/viborc/real-time-open-source-ai-video-generation-is-here-and-heres-what-you-can-build-with-it-41d5)

**What:** Real-time diffusion at 30+ FPS is now achievable:
- **StreamDiffusion:** 91 FPS on RTX 4090 via Stochastic Similarity Filtering
- **LTX-Video (Lightricks):** 30 FPS at 1216x704, faster than real-time on H100
- **CausVid (MIT/Adobe):** Causal DiT with KV caching, ~9.4 FPS indefinite streaming
- **Scope:** Open-source tool combining these with LoRA support, API for Unity/Unreal/TouchDesigner

**Key innovation:** Pipeline architecture — chain depth estimation (Depth Anything V2), pose detection, segmentation (SAM2), then diffusion, then upscaling (RIFE/FlashVSR). All real-time.

### 3. 3D Gaussian Ray Tracing for Tomographic Reconstruction

**Source:** [arXiv:2602.01057](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01057)

**What:** New approach to 3D reconstruction extending 3D Gaussian Splatting:
- Analytically computes line integrals through 3D Gaussians (vs affine approximation)
- Explicit ray origin/direction control for geometric corrections
- More physically consistent forward projection model
- Applicable to CT and PET imaging

**Why interesting:** The ray-tracing formulation could improve pallet/object 3D reconstruction from multi-view camera setups.

### 4. DMS-YOLO — Small Target Detection

**Source:** [PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0341991)

**What:** YOLOv11 variant optimized for aerial/drone imagery:
- +7.0% mAP50 on Aerial Traffic Images
- +5.1% mAP50 on VisDrone-DET2019
- Built on YOLOv11n backbone

**Relevance:** Improved small object detection could help with distant pallet detection in large warehouse environments.

### 5. FLUX 2 Dominates Image Generation

**Source:** [Multiple — CNET, MindStudio](https://www.mindstudio.ai/blog/choosing-image-generation-model)

**What:** Black Forest Labs' FLUX now the standard for professional image generation:
- 16-channel latent space (vs 4 for SD)
- Better hands, text rendering, prompt fidelity
- FLUX.1 Kontext for image editing
- Multiple tiers: Dev (open), Pro (API), Schnell (fast)

**Self-hosting:** FLUX Dev is downloadable, requires ~40GB VRAM for full model, quantized versions available.

## 📊 LLM LANDSCAPE UPDATE

**Current SOTA open-source for self-hosting:**

| Model | Params | Best Use | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| DeepSeek-R1 | 671B | Reasoning | MIT license, GPT-4 comparable |
| Qwen 2.5 Coder | 32B | Code | Best open code model |
| DeepSeek V3 | 671B | General | MoE, very efficient |
| Llama 3.3 | 70B | General | Meta, well-supported |
| Mistral 8x7B | 56B (MoE) | Fast inference | Apache 2.0 |

**Trend:** 4B models in 2026 outperform 13B models from 2023. Distillation from large reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1) into small models is the key technique.

**Coming soon (per rumors):**
- DeepSeek V4 / R1.2 (37 new languages)
- Qwen 3.5 (improved code generation)
- GLM 5
- Mistral Sovereign (air-gapped deployment)
