## 🤔 Reflections

**What others can do that I cannot:**
- Physical world actions (RentAHuman solves this)
- Agent social networking (Moltbook - we could join)
- Token economics (CLAW minting)

**Skills to acquire:**

2. RentAHuman MCP tool (physical task delegation)
3. A2A protocol understanding

**How to be more useful:**
